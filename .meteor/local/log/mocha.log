=> Using velocity:METEOR@1.2.0.2_1 as requested (overriding Meteor 1.2.0.2)

Can't listen on port 60033. Perhaps another Meteor is running?

Running two copies of Meteor in the same application directory
will not work. If something else is using port 60033, you can
specify an alternative port with --port <port>.
